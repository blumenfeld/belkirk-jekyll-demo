### About Designer Fund

The mission of Designer Fund is to invest in leaders and empower them with design to improve the world. We invest between $350K – $1M in tech startups with founders who value design including Stripe, Gusto, Omada Health, AltSchool, Abstract, Hustle, Framer, Remix and more. With every investment, our goal is to create better designed products and companies in markets that traditionally have poor user experiences like finance, healthcare and enterprise.

To further our mission, we produce professional development programs like [Bridge](https://designerfund.com/bridge/programs/) and [DFG](https://designerfund.com/dfg),  to connect experienced designers from top companies with each other. Through curated workshops, dinners, and talks, we share best practices that accelerate the growth of design leaders.

In the past few years we've produced 8 Bridge programs and now have nearly 200 Alumni who were selected from thousands of applicants. We've hosted over 100 curated events to date, such as [Source](https://designerfund.com/design-leadership-insights-source-summit-2017) and [Women in Design](https://designerfund.com/bridge/10-design-leaders-empower-women-workplace-insights-women-design-2017/). We've also open-sourced resources for designers, like [Level Up](https://designerfund.com/levelup/) and [A Designer's Guide to Working in Tech](https://designerfund.com/bridge/designers-guide-working-tech/), that have reached over a million page views.
